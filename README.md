# Sorting
Some different sorting algorithms found in computer science.

Merge Sort: Uses recursion for a divide and conquer algorithm. It works by first dividing the unsorted list into n sublist, each containing 1 element. Next it repeatedly merges the sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sorted sublist remaining.

Bubble Sort: A simple algorithm which steps through a list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It'll continue to pass through the list until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.
